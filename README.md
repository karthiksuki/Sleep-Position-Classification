# Sleep Position Classifier

A machine learning-based Sleep Position Classifier designed to identify one of three sleep postures: **Left**, **Supine**, and **Right**. The system leverages classical machine learning (SVM, KNN) and deep learning (CNN) models, using both handcrafted HOG features and raw image inputs. Additionally, a novel **Neutrosophic conversion** step is applied for enhanced preprocessing using **Falsity**, **Indeterminacy**, and **Truth** maps.

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify sleep positions based on image data. The complete pipeline includes image preprocessing using **Neutrosophy**, feature extraction using **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**, and classification using:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

---

## üìÅ Dataset

- Images of individuals in three sleep positions: **Left**, **Supine**, and **Right**
- Stored in structured class-wise directories
- Images are initially processed for Neutrosophic mapping to reduce uncertainty

## üß† Preprocessing

### Neutrosophic Image Conversion
All input images undergo transformation using the **Neutrosophic theory**, resulting in three grayscale components:
- **Falsity**
- **Indeterminacy**
- **Truth**

These components are used in downstream model training and evaluation.

### HOG Feature Extraction
- Images are transformed into HOG features with **1764 feature dimensions**
- Used as input for traditional ML models like SVM and KNN
