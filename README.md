# Sleep-Position-Classification
This project implements a multi-class classifier to detect sleep positions (Left, Supine, Right) using both classical machine learning and deep learning techniques. It incorporates advanced preprocessing with neutrosophic image transformation followed by feature extraction and classification using SVM, KNN, and CNN models.
